Python
======

python is a language
===============

language
========
provides communication

there are 2 types of languages

1.normal languages.

2.computer languages.

1.normal languages
  ================
   it provides communication among the people

  ex:-telugu,english,hindi...etc

2.computer languages
  =================
it provides communication b/w computer and user.

  there are 3 types of computer languages.

    1.manchin level language(MLL)

    2.assembely level language

    3.high levellanguage

1.m.l.l
  =====
     it is a language which is constructed with 0 and 1.

    it is not understandable to user
   
     it is understandable to only computer.


2.a.l.l
  ======
   it is also a language compelety constructed in english...
 no symbols
     a add b
     a sub b
     a store 10

    it is understandable to user
   but not understandable to computer.

 masam,tasam...etc

3.h.l.l
  =====
   it is also language which is constructed by mixing english and symbols.

   a+b
   a-b
it is understandable to user
   but not understandable to computer.

 C,C++,java,python...etc

C.U.L----------->MLL

U.U.L---------->ALL,HLL

Translators
===========
 these are used translate one language code into another language code.

 1.assembler----------all---->MLL
 2.interpreter--------HLL---->MLL
 3.compiler------------HLL---->MLL

---->the process done by interpreter is called interpretation

---->the process done by compiler is called compilation.


====>only compiler---->c,c++

===>compiler and interpreter----->java

====>interpreter-------->python

python------>interpreted---because python supports interpreter

in python only one error is displayed at a time eventhough multiple errors are there
in your python program.


python is highlevel,interpreted prgramming language.

-->python language(communication)

-->python is computer language(communication b/w user and computer)

--->python is Highlevel language(english,symbols,digits)

-->python is interpreted language(to convert from HLL to MachinLevel language)

conclusion
------------
-->python is a highlevel,interpreted programming laguage

software
========
set of programs is called software

program
=======
set of instructions/statements is called program

instruction
===========
instructions are designed to performe particular task by
the computer.

programming languages
=====================
programming languages are used to design softwares

by writting programs by wirtting instructions.


ex:- C,C++,java,python,javascript....etc
